This is simply because ‘dress watches’ have been around a lot longer than anything else, and are thus the effective archetype of what watches <em>should </em>look like. If your dad or grandfather wore a watch, its style (especially its diameter) would likely be considered dressy by larger, brasher, more modern standards.</p><p>Typical things you can expect to see in dress watches are white dials with a classical typeface (often Roman numerals, but just as commonly elegant Arabic numerals), slim line cases with a high polished finish, a leather strap, and smaller diameters. As watches become more complicated (normally with the addition of extra functions) they become thicker. Many modern dress watches are enormous by traditional standards due to the technology inside them, but they should still be easy to identify using these simple criteria. For good examples of brands that produce excellent dress watches, check out A. Lange &amp; Söhne, Frederique Constant, and Cartier on jomashop.com.</p><p>&lt;<a href="https://www.jomashop.com/audemars-piguet-watch-15710stooa002ca01.html" >Insert Audemars Piguet Image</a>&gt;</p><p><strong>Sports watches</strong></p><p>What we would class as sports watches these days (things like the Rolex Explorer or Omega Speedmaster) have been around since the 1950s (1953 and 1957 respectively), but the heyday of this genre was the 1970s. During that decade, the Rolex Daytona really took off, while the emergence of the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak paved the way for edgier design in a field that was still struggling to fully embrace the caustic masculinity needed to really sell a classic sports watch to a discerning population.</p><p>Common features are an increased size and weight, which adds durability and protection against magnetic fields, high contrast, easy-to-read dials with less-often textured dials for maximal legibility, bolder, brighter colors. Sports watches tend to have higher operating speeds too (that’s how quickly the balance wheel responsible for the timekeeping of the watch moves backwards and forwards). The faster a balance wheel moves, the better able it is to ride out the impacts and shocks one might expect a watch worn during activity to sustain. The 1969 development of the Zenith El Primero (a famously high-speed movement) ushered in a decade of explosive development for sports watches, and many modern design reference this era because of it.</p><p>&lt;<a href="https://www.jomashop.com/rolex-watch-114060.html" >Insert Rolex Submariner Image</a>&gt;</p><p><strong>Dive watches</strong></p><p>Dive watches are designed with the requirements of professional divers in mind. While this may seem like a very esoteric, and widely unappealing criteria by which to design so many watches (and there are <em>so, so </em>many), the resulting watches are very visually appealing, and the charm of their intended use consistently sees this type of wristwatch rank highly in the minds of watch lovers.</p><p>In order for a watch to be officially certified as a dive watch it must pass the ISO6425 test. In order to do that it must display water resistance up to at least 100 meters, have a luminous running indicator, a unidirectional timing bezel, magnetic resistance, be visible in the dark from 25cm, shock resistance, resistance to salinity, resistance of attachments to an external force, and be marked with either Diver's Watch ###M or Diver's ###M.</p><p>Possibly the most famous dive watch of them all is the Rolex Submariner, closely followed by the Omega Seamaster. Both styles have existed since the 1950s (with the Rolex’s roots going even further back to 1926 when the world’s most famous watch brand released the first oyster case, water resistant to 100 meters). They are still popular today, with many examples of the both the Rolex Submariner and the Omega Seamaster (and their many variations), available on Jomashop.com.</p><p>&lt;<a href="https://www.jomashop.com/iwc-watch-iw500916.html" >Insert IWC Big Pilot Image</a>&gt;</p><p><strong>Pilot watches</strong></p><p>It is often forgotten that legend tells us that the very first commercial wristwatch was inspired by the needs of a pilot. While the observations of legendary pilot Alberto Santos Dumont in 1904 inspired his friend Louis Cartier to create a special “thigh watch” for him to use while operating his craft’s controls, the watch family that <em>still </em>bears the Santos name does not look much look a Pilot’s watch at all.</p><p>Easy to spot thanks to their large cases, plain (often black) dials with clear, uncluttered dials that are exceptionally easy to read at a glance, Pilot watches are very popular today, not just because of their significance in major military operations in history (especially WWI and WWII, which have inspired countless homages), but also because of their ease of use and the honest design that seems to speak to many different consumers from different walks of life. Perhaps the most famous producers of Pilot watches are IWC and Zenith, both of which are available on jomashop.com.</p><p>&lt;<a href="https://www.jomashop.com/rolex-watch-126710bksj.html" >Insert Rolex GMT Master II Image</a>&gt;</p><p><strong>GMT watches</strong></p><p>A GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) watch is a watch able to show the time in multiple time zones simultaneously (normally two or three time zones).</p><p>While the GMT function isn’t restricted to any particular style of watch (and can feature as an additional complication on a dress, sports, dive, or pilot watch), there is quite a strong collectors’ market for a certain type of GMT watch defined by the most famous of them all: the Rolex GMT Master II.</p><p>The GMT Master I was developed with Pan-Am Pilots and released in 1955 The second edition replaced it in the Rolex catalogue in 1982 and continues to set the bar for the entire industry.</p><p>Aside from the almost unattainably popular Rolex GMT Master II ‘Pepsi’ (with a red and blue bezel so named because of the Pepsi logo’s colors), a great option can be found from sister brand Tudor. The Tudor Black Bay GMT offers a huge amount of functionality at a surprisingly reasonable price.</p> </p>
